Praser [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hacatu/Praser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hacatu/Praser)
------
Praser is a C library for creating parsers, usually ll[k] but optionally 
recursive descent.  Parsers return a parse tree, which is just an n-ary 
tree where each node has a string tag.  Several demo parsers are included,
such as `calculator_parser`.
